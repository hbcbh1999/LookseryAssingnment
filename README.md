# LookseryAssingnment

In march 2015 [Looksery](https://www.looksery.com) interviewing me asked to make small app with following requirements:

===============
App has two screens.

The first one is a list of saved user profiles and a button to add new profile.

Tapping on a cell represinting profile opens profile details screen with view and edit modes.

Profile details screen should be implemented with help of UITableView.

Profile consists of following fields:
1.	Avatar (image which could be changed with image from gallery)
2.	Name
3.	Date of birth
4.	Sex
5.	Phone number (should be a way to add several phone numbers, phone number should be checked for allowed charachters). Each phone number takes its own table cell.
6.	About. Limited to 256 lenght. Hashtags should be highlighted red. E.g., “Я работаю в #looksery. Крутая компания :)”

After filling all fields should be possible to save profile and view it.

Data should persist app rerun.
===============

This project implements this.

Looksery refused me, but that doesn't matter too much.

Later I used this project as example project showing my students at [itstep](http://itstep.org/en/) some principles. Today instaed of removing this project from hard drive I've decided just make this project public here on GitHub.

Here how it's going:
